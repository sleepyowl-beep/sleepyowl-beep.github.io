<h2>Epilogue</h2>

The first stop, I'll try to do some exercise on how to conduct a very basic XSS attack so I can at least get the concept. I never do XSS in my entire life and it's make me really nervous. Thus, I ask my friend Google if she has any recommendation for me?

I'm looking for website that provide XSS exercise where the difficulty is managable for this block head and also point me to which part of the code that is causing the problem.

Finally, I found the right one and its called:<a href="https://xss-game.appspot.com/"> https://xss-game.appspot.com/</a>

The website hosted six challenges where each stage is getting more difficult than the previous one

<h2>The condition</h2>

Before I'll go any further i would like to state some condition on how I will approach this challenge, as you can see the motivation of this blog is to help me passed OSWE. As I read through some of the source and official website, I conclude that the certification is more focus into the whitebox approach of web pentesting. Thus, rather than documenting the answer by just putting the payload and trial and error which sounds just like black box pentesting, I'll try to run the provided code locally and debug the javascript so I'll gain more understanding on how the internal works

<h2> Setup the Environment </h2>
If you interesting to setup your own environment you can check this github page to get the ready deployed version of the challenge. I make same few adjustment on the source code and update the library to the latest version

<h2> Level 1</h2>
