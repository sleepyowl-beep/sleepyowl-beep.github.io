The first stop, I'll try to do some exercise on how to conduct a very basic XSS attack so I get the concept. I never do XSS in my entire life and it's make me really nervous. Thus, I ask my friend Google if he has any recommendation for me?

I'm looking for website that host a challenge for newbie that just want to learn about the basic of XSS attack and also point me into some insecure coding example.

Finally, I found the right one and its called: https://xss-game.appspot.com/
